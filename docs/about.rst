The experiments with the `MÃ–NCH detector <https://www.psi.ch/en/lxn/moench>`_ :footcite:p:`bergamaschi2018,cartier2014,cartier2016` were 
perforemed as part of the my Bachelor thesis :footcite:p:`lunin2022` at the TU Berlin, at the 
`Max-Born-Institute <https://mbi-berlin.de/de/complex-spin-structures-group/team>`_ in Berlin, Germany.

Afterwards, multiple experiements were conducted between 2023 and 2025 and resulted of two publications: :footcite:p:`schneider2024,lunin2025`.

Due to the demand of intensive work with the detector, this software was developed to simplify the work with detector and accelerate data acquisition and processing.
